# Cat Clicker
This is the sequel to a previous project. This sequel's purpose was to show the importance of properly structuring code and how using a MVC relationship can make scaling easier. View the original project [here.](https://github.com/plasmadice/cat-clicker)

## How it works
Simply open index.html or view the [live version](http://plasmadice.github.io/cat-clicker-premium/)

There are 6 cats that you can choose by name at the top. Clicking the picture of the cat will increment the count by 1.
